			<p>
				Altspace is a fun and interesting place to spend your time,
				due in no small part to the wonderful variety of content that
				our community of developers produce. If you want to play with
				these apps yourself (or build your own app), you'll need to know
				the basics. This tutorial will cover how you can load apps into
				your events, and explains the available options on those app
				containers.
			</p>

			<h2>Enclosures and Displays</h2>

			<p>
				Altspace rooms typically have one or more spaces designated for apps.
				These are called <em>enclosures</em> in general, or <em>displays</em>
				when they're flat.
			</p>

			<p>
				Think of enclosures as web browsers that can take up space. When you
				type a regular website into an enclosure (like
				<a href='https://altvr.com'>AltVR.com</a>), it appears just as
				you'd expect. But type in the URL for an Altspace-enabled website
				(a.k.a. an app), and it will display in 3d. Depending on the app,
				you may even be able to interact with it, or with the other players.
				Try different apps, and see which you like best.
			</p>
			
			<h2>Enclosure Controls</h2>
			
			<p>
				Enclosures have the same basic controls as the standard web browser,
				plus a couple enclosure-specific ones:
			</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>
					<img class='icon' src='assets/browse.png' />
					Menu - Toggle the enclosure settings bar</li>
				<li>
					<img class='icon' src='assets/beam-clear.png' />
					Clear - Clear the enclosure of any running app</li>
				<li>&#9664; Back - Go to the previous page</li>
				<li>&#9654; Forward - Go to the next page</li>
				<li>&#10226; Refresh - Reload the current page</li>
				<li>&#128269; Search - Search Google for the entered text</li>
				<li>&#10006; Clear URL - Clear the contents of the URL bar</li>
				<li>&#127968; Home - Go to the default page for this enclosure</li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2>Personal Browser and Beaming</h2>
			
			<p>
				In addition to enclosures in rooms, you also have a personal display
				that only you can see. This display behaves just like every other
				display, plus one important feature: beaming. If you click the Beam
				(<img class='icon' src='assets/beam.png' />) icon, your current page will be
				sent to one of the room's enclosures, whichever is most appropriate
				for the content being beamed.
			</p>
			
			
			<h2>Available Apps</h2>
			
			<p>
				What good are enclosures if there's nothing to put in them? Here are
				some apps, demos, and examples that you might find interesting:
