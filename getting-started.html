			<p>
				Altspace is a fun and interesting place to spend your time,
				due in no small part to the wonderful variety of content that
				our community of developers produce. If you want to play with
				these apps yourself (or build your own app), you'll need to know
				the basics. This tutorial will cover how you can load apps into
				your events, and explains the available options on those app
				containers.

			<h2>Enclosures and Displays</h2>
			
			<p>
				Altspace rooms typically have one or more spaces designated for apps.
				These are called <em>enclosures</em> in general, or <em>displays</em>
				when they're flat.

			<p>
				Think of enclosures as web browsers that can take up space. When you
				type a regular website into an enclosure (like
				<a href='https://altvr.com'>AltVR.com</a>), and it appears just as
				you'd expect. But type in the URL for an Altspace-enabled website,
				and it will display in 3d
